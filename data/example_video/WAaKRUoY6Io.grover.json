If you never made pasta before, this is the one that you should make if you have made pasta before. I've got a tip for you that's gonna make all of your other pastas way better. Let's do it! We're gonna make a sweet onions now. The secret ingredient is not an onion, but it is important that we have very, very thin onions so it can melt. Try and get really thin. Full blast. Team: Olive oil of the extra-virgin variety, okay? A little salt. The number one thing that you guys are getting wrong is the water content. That is the secret ingredient. You can see we're getting a little bit of color on the onion here, starting to burn. It's starting to carmelize. What do we do? We take some water and what that does is it lowers the temperature of the onion to the temperature the water boils at, preventing burning. Don't be afraid about putting too much water because it's always gonna cook off and as the water cooks down it will start to burn again. And just be proficient with the water here. Salty pasta water. Everybody knows the stick, right? This is a full pounds. We're gonna use half a pound. We're cooking for two people. Boom. We have black pepper. We have red pepper. All the Italian grandmas have come together and agreed you're only allowed to use one or the other. You cannot use both. They will come. They will find you. Havoc will be wreaked, so I say red pepper. See how they're starting to turn colors? Really nice, really good onion base here and this is so much better than putting sugar into a tomato sauce.

Bring a medium-sized pot of salted water to a boil.\n2.) In a saute pan on high heat, add 2 tablespoons of olive oil and the sliced onion. Stir and add a pinch of salt. Once onions begin to turn brown, add a ladleful of water from the pasta pot.\n3.) Continue to cook down the onions and add water until they are soft and medium brown in color, about 25 minutes.\n4.) Once onions are caramelized, add a pinch of red pepper flakes and the tomatoes to the saute pan, lower the heat to medium and simmer. If the sauce looks too thick, add water from the pasta pot to thin out.\n5.) Add pasta to the boiling water, and cook 2 minutes less than box instructions.\n6.) Once the pasta is cooked, add it to the sauce. Turn the heat to high, add a ladle of pasta water and stir well for 2 minutes. Remove from heat, add the cheese, another ladleful of water, and stir to combine. Stir in lemon zest and more water if needed to thin out.\n7.) Transfer to a plate and garnish with more cheese, parsley and a splash of olive oil.\n\nFor more amazing shows & recipes download the Tastemade App:
